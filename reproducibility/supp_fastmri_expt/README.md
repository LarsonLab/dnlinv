# Reconstruction experiments using data from the fastMRI knee challenge with an autocalibrated sampling pattern

All data are from the validation set of the fastMRI knee challenge. Only 3T data were used in these experiments.
Proton-density (PD) and proton-density fat suppressed (PDFS) acquisitions are reconstructed separately.

Directories:
1. `pd` contains the autocalibrated 3T PD knee reconstructions
2. `pdfs` contains the autocalibrated 3T PDFS knee reconstructions
3. `pd_multiple` contains the autocalibrated 3T PD knee reconstructions for 10 cases from the validation set.
4. `pdfs_multiple`contains the autocalibrated 3T PDFS knee reconstructions for 10 cases from the validation set
